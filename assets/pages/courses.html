                            The Organic Insecticides Workshop was held in the
                            community of Periquito. Organic insecticides can be
                            prepared with vegetative materials that grow nearby
                            and/or natural materials that can be easily obtained,
                            therefore, their use has the advantage that the cost of
                            the insecticide is very low, in addition to the impacts
                            to both the environment and humans are minimal.

                            and there was a lot of participation from both the
                            members of the irrigation association and the youth.
